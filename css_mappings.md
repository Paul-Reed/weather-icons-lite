**NOTE** - Because the Moon icons are representative of a 'physical moon', it is necessary to have an additional version for the dark theme, to avoid the icon colour becoming inverted. The dark theme version is obtained by adding `-dark` to the CSS code. For example to get the full moon (light theme version) the code would be `wi-moon-full`, whilst the same icon for a dark theme, the CSS code would be `wi-moon-full-dark`.
